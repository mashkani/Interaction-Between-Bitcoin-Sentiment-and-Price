# Interaction-Between-Bitcoin-Sentiment-and-Price
This project was completed for my Quantitative Economic Modelling class at UBC taught by Professor Paul Schrimpf. 
In this project I explore data scraping, sentiment analysis and classification analysis in an attempt to find the 
interaction between Bitcoin sentiment and Bitcoin price.
